# Jupyter Notebook Fixer

---
### This code reads a Jupyter notebook file named File-Name.ipynb and converts it to version 4 
### (if it has an older version) and then saves it with a new name File-Name-Update.ipynb.
### This ensures the notebook file is converted to the latest compatible version, resolving
### potential issues caused by older versions.

---

## Steps:

- 1. Importing the `nbformat` library
- 2. Loading the notebook file
- 3. Saving the notebook file with the latest version
---

- ### ! This code only accepts one file (.ipynb)
